Data Elements (DEs)
===================

RDRF allows creation of resusable fields, which can be dropped into the definition of sections of :ref:`forms <registries>`, simply by entering their code into the elements field of the section definition (in a comma separated list).

A DE is created by an admin user navigating to "Data Elements"  in "Settings"

DEs can be shared by all registries created within the framework. A DE definition consists of:


Code
----

A DE must have a *globally unique code* (e.g. CDEAge, CDEInsulinLevel) which must not contain a space.

A meaningful code prefixed with CDE or the Registry Code is recommended. 



Name
----

A non blank "name" must also be entered, which will be used as the label of the component when it appears
on the form.


Desc
----

Origin of the field if externally loaded.


Datatype
--------

Each cde must have a data type specified by a text descriptor. Currently this descriptor is specified as free text although this may change.


The allowed :ref:`datatypes` are as follows (NB. These are the literal words to type into the datatype field, *except* for ComplexField) 


* string
* integer
* alphanumeric
* boolean
* float
* range
* calculated
* file
* date
* ComplexField




Pv group
--------
*IF* a range, select the desired :ref:`permitted value group <permittedvaluegroup>` here.


Allow multiple
-------------
*IF* a range, checking this box will allow multple selections to be chosen from the range.

Example
^^^^^^^

* Brands of cars owned
* Medications taken


Max length
----------
*IF* a string value, the maximum number of characters allowed.


Max value
---------
*IF* an integer or a float value, the maximum magnitude allowed.


Min value
---------
*IF* an integer or a float value, the minimum magnitude allowed.


Is required
-----------
A check box indicating whether this field is mandatory (any datatype)


Pattern
-------
*IF* a string value, a regular expression used to indicate admissible values
(note these are always case sensitive in the current version).


Widget name
-----------
The name of a custom widget to visually present the data, or an an alternative widget 
from the default. *IMPORTANT!* The custom widget must already be provided in the codebase otherwise an error
will occur. If this field is left blank ( the default ), the default widget for the specified datatype
will be used, which should be good enough in 99% per cent of cases.



Derived Data Element (DDE)
--------------------------

*IF* a calculated field, a fragment of javascript outlined in :ref:`Derived Data Elements <datatypes>`.
Leave blank if not a calculated field.
